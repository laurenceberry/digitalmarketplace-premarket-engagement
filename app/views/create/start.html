        <p>If youâ€™re planning to buy services for digital projects, you can choose to talk to suppliers before you start the buying process. Early market engagement helps you:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
	        <li>understand your requirements better</li>
					<li>write clearer requirements to publish to suppliers</li>
					<li>understand how much the work could cost</li>
					<li>understand how long the work could take</li>
					<li>write a better business case for spending controls or internal approval</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>If you choose to do early market engagement, you must do it before you publish your requirements on the Digital Marketplace.</p>
